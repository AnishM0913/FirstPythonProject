Tic tac toe in python
Made this a while ago last year. Figured I should upload my first project in python. 
Its a simple tic tac toe game, you just enter a value between 1 and 9 that represents the 9 squares on the board to make your selection. 
Keep doing that until either you or the computer wins.
